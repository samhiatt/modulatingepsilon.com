  symbol[^1]: "in [[machine learning]], within the subfield of [[reinforcement learning]], a small probability parameter (typically 0 < ε < 1) that determines the frequency of exploration versus exploitation; specifically, the probability of selecting a random action rather than the greedy action with the highest estimated value."

	In the second edition of _Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction_ (2018), Sutton and Barto provide the following concise definition in **Section 2.2**:
	> "A simple alternative is to behave greedily most of the time, but every once in a while, say with small probability $\epsilon$, instead select randomly from among all the actions with equal probability, independently of the action-value estimates."
